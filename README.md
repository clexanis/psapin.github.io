##Personal Site

Hi, I'm Patrick and this is my github pages page.
Glad you could make it.


###Rainbow Stalin
Since this still gets hits and was on the front page of reddit I'm keeping it up at /rainbowstalin.html

Please enjoy a complimentary Rainbow-Stalin site I made in 2011.

NEW AND IMPROVED FOR 2014!

	Audio tag instead of 0x0 youtube embed

	Snowing Head-Bobbing Stalins

	14 New Rainbow Stalins (carousel)

	Rainbow over Stalin now Animated


I did not write the animated css-rainbow background.
I did not create any of the images.
I did not create the music.
I did not create the snowing or carousel scripts.
